  <h1>MATH IS POETRY. PHYSICS IS POETRY IN MOTION.</h1>

  <p><strong>ON RESEARCH:</strong><br>
    A strong need to stand out after losing my LinkedIn page inspired a chance to focus on a recently learned math problem that is yet to be solved.<br>
    <strong>GOAL:</strong> Provide a novel perspective or framing of the problem that I could offer as work/analysis/ingenuity for job searching.
  </p>

  <p>I never expected this development.</p>

  <p>I love how basic math theory works â€” looking at numbers, trying to understand fundamentally how they tie to our existence. A part of my process includes examining and testing what might seem outside usual rationale. These papers are currently unpublished. Submissions have been made to reputable archives. Public drafts and source materials are provided below for independent review and reference.</p>

  <p>I have not been funded, and I am not monetizing from these efforts. This includes this website. There are means asking for donations as the work has been funded by savings (incl. retirement).</p>

    <strong>Author's Note:</strong><br>
    It is recognized and acknowledged that enthusiasm is no substitute for advanced education or professional experience. If it helps, the author was the type to be grades ahead in math classes, with placing out of first-year college physics and calculus. These ideas come from a lifetime of interest and contemplation of the disciplines, with adjoining respect for their institutions. Please know they are not random or offered lightly. The overarching intent and hope is to benefit the worlds of math, science and humanity.
