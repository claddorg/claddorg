      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>I am a hyper-creative who loves to solution. My lifetime follows periods of design, construction and implementation, while expanding my learning and experiences.</p>
      <p>Lately, the focus has been exploring being an independent researcher focused on a long-standing math problem that unexpectedly led to fascinating adjacent topics. This originated with an intent to perhaps produce a novel analytical method, a perspective, an item of work for the resume. But the exercise unfolded into much more.</p>
      <p><em>(Note on 2023)</em> Regarding my LinkedIn page: Feb 2023 to present has not been the best between us. My 15-yr/500+ connected profile created during business school was mistakenly deleted.</p>
